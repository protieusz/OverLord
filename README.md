# OverLord

Lotus layout unified split with 2x mcus & 2x trackballs.

# Detailed Summary

OverLord is a heavily modified version of Noraneko42L which has been blessed by darakuneko himself for the mod. Noraneko42L was originally designed by [darakuneko](https://github.com/darakuneko/Noraneko/tree/main/noraneko42l).

A List Of Mods Made To The Original PCB file by darakuneko:

-Eliminate the extra 6th columns on each sides.

-Two square hole was created in the middle that can accomodate 2x 25mm trackballs powered by 2x PMW3360 sensors.

-Base of the trackball holders with lens cut out is integrated into the top case with integrated 5mm switch plate. Top case sits flush with pcb.

-Full keyboard case was created to house the PCB.

-OverLord is powered by 2x RP2040 Core - As which you can get from AE.

-Shout out to miketronic from Fingerpunch discord for helping me with the QMK coding from his [BR/KN](https://github.com/miketronic/brkn-keyboard) and modifing the matrix to fit my OverLord. No suppport will be given since I just copy and paste.

-Shout to Doesntfazer of KeyboardDweebs.net for proofing reading and sanity checking my PCB schematic.

-Use M2 brass hot inserts 3.2mm diameter and 4mm length for the M2 screws to secure the case. I forgot how long is my M2 screws are but they should be greater than 10mm so estimated around 14.6mm. Play around with and buy multiple M2 lenght screws.

-"Eye of Sauron" icon logo embross on the top case was borrowed from [Symbolon from the Noun Project](https://thenounproject.com/icon/eye-of-sauron-1007756/). "Eye of Sauron" logo was used to give it a dark lord theme.

-Both RP2040 Core-A mcus will be "linked" together by header pin wires instead of TRRS connector.
